/**
 * DEPRECATED - NOT CURRENTLY USED
 * 
 * This file was originally created to provide a Buffer polyfill for
 * the npm StegCloak package, but we've since switched to our own 
 * implementation that uses Node.js Buffer directly (which is provided
 * by the Buffer npm package).
 * 
 * This file is no longer imported in main.tsx, but we're keeping it
 * for reference and to prevent any import errors elsewhere in the code.
